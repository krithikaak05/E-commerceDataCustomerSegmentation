# Customer Segmentation

:chart_with_upwards_trend: **Introduction:**

This project is centered around creating a Customer Segmentation model using the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis method. The dataset, obtained from Kaggle ([link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carrie1/ecommerce-data)), offers valuable insights into customer purchasing behavior in the realm of e-commerce.

:rocket: **Motivation:**

The project's motivation stems from the transformative potential of leveraging RFM analysis for customer segmentation. In the dynamic e-commerce landscape, personalized marketing is crucial. By understanding customer behavior, preferences, and employing RFM segmentation, the project aims to provide actionable insights for targeted engagement. The Kaggle dataset serves as a real-world context, offering practical insights into diverse online retail behaviors. Additionally, the project acts as a hands-on opportunity to enhance skills in data preprocessing, advanced analytics, and visualization within the realm of data science and business analytics. The anticipated impact lies in optimizing marketing strategies, improving customer satisfaction, and contributing to a deeper understanding of the intricate dynamics in the e-commerce ecosystem.

:hammer_and_wrench: **Working:**

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Delved into the dataset, understanding transaction nuances between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based online retail company.
   - Unveiled patterns, trends, and outliers, setting the stage for a deeper exploration.

2. **RFM Analysis:**
   - Employed RFM analysis, evaluating customer behavior based on Recency (R), Frequency (F), and Monetary (M) dimensions.
   - Calculated RFM scores and segmented customers into nine distinct groups, gaining nuanced insights for targeted strategies.

3. **K-Nearest Means Clustering:**
   - Leveraged kNN clustering to further dissect customer behavior, revealing three clusters representing unique customer profiles.
   - Considered the proximity of customers in the feature space, providing a different perspective on segmentation.

4. **Choosing Both RFM and KNN?**
   - The strategic decision to use both RFM and kNN: RFM for detailed segmentation and precise targeting, kNN for a holistic view of customer proximity.
   - RFM offered depth in understanding transaction patterns, while kNN provided breadth by considering a holistic view of customer proximity.
   - The combination ensures a comprehensive analysis, yielding well-rounded and actionable insights.
